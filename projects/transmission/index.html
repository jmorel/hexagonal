        <p><a href="http://transmission.artsappliques-dreux.fr/">Trans'mission</a> is an joint initiative from the design section of the <a href="http://www.lyceebranlydreux.fr/">Lycée Edouard Branly</a> and the famous charity, <a href="http://www.restosducoeur.org/">Les Restaurants du Coeur</a>.</p>

        <p>During 4 months, students were tasks to design objects using textiles provided by <i>Les Restos du Coeur</i>. At the end of the 4 months, all projects were on display at a nearby theater (<a href="http://www.latelier-a-spectacle.com/">L'atelier à Spectacles</a>) and auctioned for food donations.</p>

        <p>With no visual guidelines, project's photos provided a couple of days before the launch and a very limited amount of time for design and development, this website had to be built with placeholders and be simple enough so that it could be adapted to new content in no time.</p>

        <p>In the end, the whole project was a success, raising more than expected for the charity.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>One page design: with little content focused around a single message, multiple pages would have weighted on the communication.</li>
                <li>The content is organized around two directions: vertical scrolling for information about the exhibition, horizontal scrolling to see the objects.</li>
                <li>Deep links to each object allow the users to easily share their favourites. No social network integration was implemented because of time constraints.</li>
                <li>Fixed header serves as both quick access to sections and position indicator within the page.</li> 
                <li>The use of soft, fabric textures with stitching builds a metaphor tiying together design, content and the students work.</li>
                <li>Images are resized so that they fill the screen entirely. The user can then navigate between objects without distractions, focused on the exhibition itself.</li>
