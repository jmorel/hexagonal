    <div class="abstract">
        
        <p>The redesign of <a href="http://www.au-fil-de-lyon.com">Au fil de Lyon</a> proved a challenge because of its target audience. Though Lyon is the second largest french city, it is nowhere near Paris in terms of tourism. Tourists flock to the city for its world renowned <a href="http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/EN_2012">festival of lights</a> but aren't a year-long driving force in the local economy. As a result, tour guides work mainly for local residents interested in the city's history, politics and town-planning. Sadly enough these people, however brilliant, are often pensioners and less than knowledgeable when it comes to browsing the web.</p>

        <p>The main goal of this redesign was therefore not to add eye-candy to an existing structure but rather re-think what information is displayed, how it should be so and how to guide the user through the information without him feeling lost, wondering where to find this or that or even what to do next.</p>
