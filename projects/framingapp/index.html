    <div class="abstract">
        <p>Prints are getting cheaper and cheaper, but only as long as you're not looking for something larger than A3. From that moment on, price per square meter skyrocket. Many went for a DIY solution: printing over many sheets of paper (A5, A4, A3...) using whatever printer you can get either at home or at work, cutting out the margins and re-assembling the whole thing together. But it looks bad. For technical reasons first: it's quite difficult to put the sheets together without any shift error. And these errors propagates. Which means that the larger the print, the worst the result. It's also because we are being dishonest about the technique: we expect the result to be the one of a single sheet whereas it is impossible to hide the multiple junctions, especially because our eyes are great are at detecting faults in straight lines.</p>

        <p>Instead of fighting the technique, <a href="http://framingapp.com">Framing App</a> embraces it. Instead of using the single sheet of paper as a necessary evil, it choses to reinterpret it as a frame through which a part of the image is visible and encourages you to play with various margin sizes. It also gets rid of the regular tiling paradigm, and allows for the frames to be placed anywhere.</p>
